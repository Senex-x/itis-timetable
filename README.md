# ITIS Timetable
Application for ITIS students to view their timetables in a convenient way. 

Original timetable content lies in the [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wDMuQdYC4ewmW6qSUPFN4VL5_0cxAnI03QcSbIHrla4/edit?usp=sharing). 
To parse it, I wrote a designated [Spring Boot application](https://github.com/Senex-x/itis-timetable-parser) â€” a convenient REST API that I utilize in this app. This way user always has the latest timetable version 
while still being able to view it offline thanks to the cache in the local database.

## Key features 
* Timetable content caching
* Automatic synchronization of local timetable data with the remote state
* Unwanted subjects can be hidden from the schedule
* Simple and user-friendly UI
* Dark theme

## Main screen
Main screen of the application displays daily schedule for the group picked by user. Horizontal scrolling allows to view schedule for each day of the timetable.
